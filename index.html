  <h1> Welcome, Fresher! </h1>
  <p> You are hereby invited to attend an evening of fun and drinks with fellow computer scientists this <b>Thursday 26th</b> </p>
  <p> Attendance is not compulsory but <b> highly recommended </b>. Please arrive at <b>6pm</b>, Ground floor of ARCO </p>
  <p> Pizza will be provided shortly after and a full open bar is available all evening (while stocks last) serving alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks free of charge. </p>
  <p> We're prepared some amazing CompSci games (of both the drinking & non-drinking varieties) for you to play, there should be fun to be had for all </p>
  <p> Later on we will join with the maths freshers who have been at a similar (albeit lower budget) evening in a head to head clash to determine once and for all, who is the king of the mathematical sciences? </p>  
  <p> I appreciate this is short notice but it would be nice to see as many of you there as possible, I promise that this will be a night to remember </p>
  <p> much love, </p>
  <p> Jack & Matt (Your subject reps) </p>
